      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the US Federal Trade Commission freed millions of Americans from a powerful constraint on their labor-market mobility by banning non-compete clauses for most workers. It was one of the biggest policy wins for American workers in recent years – and, because of Donald Trump's administration, it may never take effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Western countries have been generous in supporting Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, their financial assistance can be used only for non-military purposes. Instead of deploying aid this way, which creates distortions that undermine Ukraine’s war effort, foreign donors should directly fund defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of continuing to wait for aid, Africa is seeking to mobilize investment in its green transition, not because rich countries “owe” Africans – though they do – but because Africa can help the world tackle climate change.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the European Union tries to put together a large loan for Ukraine, sovereign guarantees and the risk they pose to member states' credit ratings have become a stumbling block.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, China learned the hard way that once supply chains reorganize, they never return to their previous form. By relying on tariffs and subsidies, the United States is now paying the price for underestimating how tightly its economy is bound to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Europe’s competitiveness concerns are understandable, inaction on social and environmental challenges also carries high economic costs. Rather than resign itself to stifling its nascent sustainability-disclosure regime under pressure from the US, the EU should devise a new system based on products, not industries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine with a reparations loan drawing on frozen Russian funds is the right choice not only morally, financially, and legally, but also politically. With Ukraine's economy devastated by the exogenous shock of Russian aggression, Western leaders have a chance to show that they are equal to the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, European governments worked together to create an aircraft manufacturer capable of competing with the US firm Boeing. As a handful of private companies in Shenzhen and Silicon Valley race to entrench their AI dominance, similarly bold cooperation among middle powers has become imperative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;China’s continued dominance in low-skill export sectors reflects not just efficiency, but deliberate policy choices that prevent poorer countries from climbing the development ladder.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;International institutions and think tanks have published detailed warnings about Europe’s demographic decline since the turn of the century, but to no avail.
